      Create a new React component. $ARGUMENTS should contain the component name and description.

      Steps:
      1. Analyze existing component patterns:
         - File naming convention (PascalCase, kebab-case, index.tsx barrel)
         - Component style (function components, arrow functions)
         - Styling approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
         - State management pattern (hooks, context, store)
         - Props pattern (inline types, separate interface, shared types)
      2. Create the component matching discovered patterns:
         - Component file with proper TypeScript props interface
         - Styles file if the project uses co-located styles
         - Index barrel export if the project uses them
      3. Add tests:
         - Renders without crashing
         - Displays expected content with given props
         - Handles user interaction (click, input) if applicable
      4. Export from the nearest index file

      Follow existing patterns. Do NOT introduce new styling or state management approaches.

    content: |
      Analyze React components for performance issues. If $ARGUMENTS specifies a component, focus there. Otherwise, scan the project.

      Check for:
      1. **Unnecessary re-renders**:
         - Components missing `React.memo` where props rarely change
         - Inline object/array/function creation in JSX props
         - Missing `useCallback` / `useMemo` for expensive operations
      2. **State management**:
         - State stored too high in the tree causing cascading renders
         - Derived state that should be computed (not stored)
         - Missing state colocation
      3. **Data fetching**:
         - Missing loading/error states
         - No request deduplication or caching
         - Waterfalls (sequential fetches that could be parallel)
      4. **Bundle size**:
         - Large imports that could be lazy-loaded
         - Missing code splitting at route boundaries

      For each issue found, provide the file, line, problem, and fix with code.
