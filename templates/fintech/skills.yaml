      Audit the codebase for monetary calculation risks.

      Scan for:
      1. **Floating-point arithmetic on money**:
         - Any use of `float`, `double`, or JavaScript `number` for currency amounts
         - Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on money values without decimal/integer cents
         - Rounding errors in tax, discount, or fee calculations
      2. **Currency handling**:
         - Money values stored without currency code
         - Mixed-currency arithmetic without explicit conversion
         - Missing exchange rate snapshots for audit trail
      3. **Rounding**:
         - Inconsistent rounding modes (banker's rounding vs. standard)
         - Rounding applied at intermediate steps instead of final result
         - Missing rounding specification in calculations
      4. **Overflow / precision**:
         - Integer cents stored in types too small for large amounts
         - Multiplication (e.g., interest) without precision guards
         - Division without remainder handling

      For each finding, report:
      - **File**: path
      - **Line**: number
      - **Risk**: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM
      - **Issue**: what could go wrong
      - **Fix**: recommended change (e.g., use Decimal library, store as integer cents)
