    description: "Scan codebase for PHI exposure risks"
    tier: core
    content: |
      Audit the codebase for Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure risks.

      Scan for:
      1. **Logging**: Search for log statements that might include PHI fields:
         - Patient name, DOB, SSN, MRN, address, phone, email
         - Diagnosis codes, treatment plans, lab results
         - Any field from a patient/member/encounter model
      2. **Error messages**: Check that error responses don't leak PHI in:
         - API error bodies
         - Exception messages
         - Stack traces exposed to clients
      3. **Storage**: Verify PHI at rest is protected:
         - Database fields containing PHI are identified and encrypted
         - File uploads with PHI use encrypted storage
         - Temporary files are cleaned up
      4. **Transmission**: Verify PHI in transit:
         - All endpoints serving PHI require HTTPS
         - No PHI in URL query parameters (use POST body)
         - No PHI in client-side analytics or tracking

      Report each finding with:
      - **File**: path
      - **Line**: number
      - **Risk**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
      - **PHI type**: what data is exposed
      - **Fix**: recommended remediation
