      Check the project for HIPAA technical safeguard compliance.

      Verify each requirement:

      **Access Controls (§164.312(a))**:
      - [ ] Unique user identification — every user has a unique ID
      - [ ] Emergency access procedure — documented break-glass process
      - [ ] Automatic logoff — session timeout configured
      - [ ] Encryption/decryption — PHI encrypted at rest

      **Audit Controls (§164.312(b))**:
      - [ ] Audit logging enabled for all PHI access
      - [ ] Logs include: who, what, when, where (IP)

      - [ ] Log retention meets minimum period (6 years)

      **Integrity Controls (§164.312(c))**:
      - [ ] Data validation on PHI fields
      - [ ] Checksums or signatures for data integrity verification

      For each gap, report:
      - **Requirement**: HIPAA section reference
      - **Status**: COMPLIANT | GAP | PARTIAL
      - **Finding**: what's missing
      - **Remediation**: specific implementation steps
